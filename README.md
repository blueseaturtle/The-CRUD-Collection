# The-CRUD-Collection üéÉ

This repository hopes to serve as a library for apps built with the basic operations of Create, Read, Update and Delete.
Feel free to contribute to this repository with any exciting projects you have built that fall under this category!

## How to contribute
1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork to your machine.
3. Create a branch for yourself.
4. If a folder for the language/technology used in your app **does not already exist**, create a folder giving the name of the technology/combination of technologies used (e.g. MERN). Else, skip this step and move to step 5.
5. Create a sub-folder with your project name, and add your project to it.
6. Commit and push your changes.
7. Create a pull request to the main branch of this repository.

### NOTE ‚≠ê
It would be really helpful if a README.md file could be added to the **root of your project folder** describing the following:
- What your project is about.
- Prerequisites needed to run the project locally.
- How the project can be run locally.

Thanks!
